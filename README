|DESCRIPTION|
=============
Axel Game Map Editor, henceforth referred to as Axel-GME, is a program
designed to help, as the title implies, the creating of maps for games.
Its main function is to allow the user to be able to create and place 
blocks on the screen representing objects in the game that they are making.
