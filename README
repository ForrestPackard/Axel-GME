|DESCRIPTION|
=============
Axel Game Map Editor, henceforth referred to as Axel-GME, is a program
designed to help, as the title implies, the creating of maps for games.
Its main function is to allow the user to be able to create and place 
blocks on the screen representing objects in the game that they are making.


|INSTALLATION|
==============
For this program, you will need Python 3 (preferably 3.6 or up) and Pygame 1.9.
You can download them here:
Python 3 (make sure to get the 64 bit version): 
https://www.python.org/downloads/
Pygame: 1.9: pygame.org

Once you have Python 3 and Pygame downloaded,
download the program code from here: 
https://github.com/seanshin2647/Axel-GME/releases/tag/v0.1.1
Unpack the .zip file and move the code to wherever you need it to be.

An .exe file will be uploaded soon.

|INSTRUCTIONS|
==============
Once in the program, click on the screen to create blocks. These blocks
will be saved into a text file upon exit. The blocks are represented in
the text file as an "X".
